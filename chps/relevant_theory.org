On this Chapter we will present the fundamental concepts and theories related to our edge computing
infrastructure solution.
** Fog & Edge computing
@@latex:\noindent@@
Edge Computing is a recent paradigm, which moves computing application and services from centralized
units into the logical extremes or at the closest locations to the source and provides data
processing power there.

Fog computing is an architecture that uses edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of computation,
storage, communication locally and routed over the internet backbone, and most definitively has
input and output from the physical world.

Fog computing consists of Edge nodes directly performing physical input and output often to
achieve sensor input, display output, or full closed loop process control, at the Edge or nearer
to the Edge than centralized Clouds residing in very large data centers.
Fog computing places edge nodes at the edge of the network, providing attractive computing
capabilities, storage capacity, network services for edge devices.[1]

** Infrastructure as Code
** Virtualization
Virtualization, in computing, is a term that refers to the various techniques, methods or
approaches of creating a virtual version of something, such as a virtual hardware platform,
operating system, storage device, or network resources,  by providing  hardware abstraction

*** Hypervisor:
@@latex:\noindent@@
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, is a piece of computer software, firmware,
or hardware that creates and manages virtual machines.
A host machine is a computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines.
Each virtual machine is referred to as a guest machine.
The hypervisor provides a virtual operating system to the guest operating systems. 

**** Type1:
@@latex:\noindent@@
the Hypervisor interacts directly with the computer's physical hardware, the CPU, memory and storage
example: xen server, Vmware Exsi, Microsoft Hyper-v

**** Type2:
@@latex:\noindent@@
The Hypervisor that is installed as a Software Application on an existing operating system ,
this type is used for client or end-user systems
example: oracle virtual box, Vmware workstation
** Containerization
** Microservices
** High availability and Load Balancing
