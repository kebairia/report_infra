We can now see that these technologies and approaches are important pieces of a larger puzzle, starting
with the acrlong:iot, which makes our environment interactive and allows us to extract information
about it and use it again for better control over it, and cloud computing, which aimed to improve
the user experience while avoiding the resource-constrained nature of `things'.
And Edge computing, which can be thought of as a complement to cloud computing by offloading some
of the ordinary computing operations near the network's edge.
