3) Introduction: introduce the problematic of our thesis


4) Chapter1: Video management systems
   -- on this chapter will talk in general about video surveillance
      and the VMS(definitions,characteristics, how it works ... )


5) chapter2: IOT, cloud computing , egde and fog computing 
        
       part1: IOT
          -- on this part we'll talk about IOT(definitions, architectures ...)
        
        
       part2: cloud computing and IOT
          -- we'll talk about cloud computing (definitions, architectures ..)
          -- how cloud computing work with IOT
          -- then we'll introduce the problematic of cloud computing(latency, security, privacy ...)  with IOT
        
        
       part3: egde and Fog computing
          -- this part will contain all about egde and fog (definitions, characteristics, ...) 



6) chapter3: egde and fog computing on VMS (state of art)
             -- talk about how egde works with VMS
             -- Comparative study on the existing solutions of egde on VMS
