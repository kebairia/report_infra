No one can make it from naive enthusiasm to fnished dissertation without
a lot of support, both technical and emotional. we were fortunate to be supported
by a committee with diverse perspectives, taste, and wisdomâ€”and to have
each member enter the scene at just the right time.

We would cordially like to acknowledge the constant support of
my supervisors.\\
*Pr. A. Rahmoun* and  *Dr H. Bensenane*.
We have been amazingly fortunate to have an inspiring and friendly
supervisors. Their consistent notation and constructive criticisms
in my writings have proved to be instrumental in achieving my goals.\\
*The Higher School Of Computer Science -- 08 Mai 1945, SBA*, for
giving me an opportunity to do my masters. we feel very privileged to be
part of a brilliant institute that had polished my skills. we cant thank my
university enough.

Last but not the least, this acknowledgement would be incomplete if we 
don't mention our team mates and friends *Moubarek Safari* & *Baali Ahmed*,
who participated with us in this project, whether by advice, counseling and support.\\
